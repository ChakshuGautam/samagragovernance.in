overview:
  - text: >-
      In 2019, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)
      released its Vision 2025 document. This was an effort towards outlining a
      forward-looking vision that lays out the strategic priorities for the
      Ministry in the coming five years, corresponding opportunity areas and a
      framework to help prioritise them. Samagraâ€™s Skill India team is working
      with MSDE to convert this vision into an action plan for implementation.
      The strategic priorities of the Ministry over the next five years are
      improving the delivery of skill training in existing institutions,
      promoting apprenticeship as an essential part of skilling, integrating
      general and vocational education, catalyzing demand for formal skilling
      and entrepreneurship, converging skilling schemes across ministries and
      assuring quality through effective regulation and governance.

      Based on insights from the Vision 2025 document and consultations with
      ministry officials and subject matter experts, a list of 20 initiatives
      have been identified for implementation. The ownership of each of these
      initiatives rests with a senior official within MSDE. Samagra is
      co-working with these officials to design the initiatives. Individual
      initiatives would further be linked and converted into a coherent unified
      roadmap. Lastly, a review structure will be designed for the
      implementation phase and establishing accountability.
