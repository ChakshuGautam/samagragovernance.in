      The Chief Minister’s Good Governance Associates (CMGGA) Programme is a
      partnership between the Government of Haryana and Ashoka University,
      designed and managed by Samagra. Designed as an experiential programme,
      CMGGA aims to recruit young men and women to work with the district
      administrations in Haryana as representatives of the Chief Minister of the
      state. Associates are posted in each of the 22 districts of Haryana for a
      12-month period where they represent the Chief Minister’s Office and work
      closely with the Deputy Commissioner and other district officials. Through
      the period of their engagement, the Associates interact periodically with
      the Chief Minister to present the work done and assist in the
      decision-making process at the highest levels of government at the state.

      The CMGGA programme was designed to be a structured, experiential learning
      opportunity that would be useful for the government as well as the
      selected candidates. During the one year programme, CMGGAs are provided
      clearly defined work modules with specific objectives. The idea is to
      ensure they are actively involved in driving the Chief Minister’s
      priorities in a structured manner with requisite mentorship, instead of
      spending the year finding their own way across the bureaucratic labyrinth.
      This serves as an invaluable opportunity for youth to understand how the
      wheels of governance move on the ground and for the government to involve
      more youth in public administration.

        Associates work with district and block education officials as well as
        teachers to ensure that the state government's educational intitiaitves
        are implemented effectively on the ground. This includes conducting
        third-party competency pre-assessment tests, driving the adoption of the
        government's teacher training and school monitoring app, implementing
        online HR management systems, among others. Associates help district
        officers make plans, organise structured reviews and consolidate
        feedback from the ground for the state government to design
        interventions.

        Associates have been instrumental in making the Chief Minister's vision
        of transforming public service delivery in Haryana a reality. When the
        initiative was launched, Associates conducted a comprehensive diagnostic
        of the existing public service delivery system which brought forth its
        shortcomings. Based on this diagnosis, they then took on the task of
        revamping and standardizing the way service delivery centres operated
        across the state. Simultaneously, more than 100 services and schemes
        were brought online to the Antyodaya Saral portal. Today, the portal has
        more than 500 schemes and services across 36 government departments.
        Associates have been the driving force behind operationalizing the
        service delivery centres.

        Citizens typically have to run from pillar to post to get grievances
        resolved. To this end, the Chief Minister of Haryana set up an online
        grievance monitoring system. However, this initiative also suffered from
        inefficiency and poor redressal rate. To mitigate this challenge,
        Associates established and institutionalised a weekly district level
        review mechanism which supports Deputy Commissioners in redressing
        complaints, resulting in an increased grievance disposal rate of 70-80%.
