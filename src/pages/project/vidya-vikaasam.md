  - text: >-
      The key objective of Vidya Vikaasam was to improve learning outcomes of
      students in government schools in Andhra Pradesh by 6-8% through
      data-backed reviews and cascaded accountability mechanisms. Between 2017
      and 2019, Vidya Vikaasamâ€™s initiatives touched 17 lakh students in the
      state and 25,000 teachers. Data-backed decision-making was embedded in the
      higher levels of the school education department, with assessment data
      being used by the department leadership for conducting reviews and taking
      policy decisions.

  - text: >-
      There were three broad levers through which the engagement's objectives
      were sought to be achieved. First, an assessment framework to build the
      capacity of the Department of Education to create, conduct and analyse
      high quality assessments. Second, strengthening direct levers of learning
      level outcomes such as remedial teaching, teacher training and academic
      monitoring. Third, setting up systems to close the assessment feedback
      loop by sharing the results of high-quality assessments with teachers and
      parents for corrective action.
