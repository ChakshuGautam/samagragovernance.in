  text: >-
    One of the biggest challenges facing our country is generating employment
    for its burgeoning workforce. To make its youth job-ready and able
    contributors to the economy, the Government of Haryana launched the Saksham
    Haryana-Skills and Employment programme to increase employment opportunities
    in the state and improve the quality of skilling. Samagra’s Saksham
    Haryana-Skills and Employment team works with the the Department of
    Employment and Department of Skill Development and Industrial Training to
    systemically transform the state’s employment and skilling domain.

    Our approach to improving agricultural productivity in Odisha is centred on
    leveraging data and technology to arm the state government and farmers with
    timely information that can translate into informed choices. This vision is
    being realized through a Decision Support System or ADAPT Dashboard that
    integrates agricultural data from multiple databases into a single online
    portal for use by government officials. This allows the government to make
    evidence-based policy decisions, pre-empt challenges and respond effectively
    to farmer needs. Through public messaging campaigns and extension workers,
    pest and weather advisories, information on seed treatment and soil health,
    irrigation and insurance is disseminated to farmers.

      Between 2017 and 2019, public sector recruitment has increased
      significantly in Haryana with over 60,000 appointments. No government in
      the state in the last two decades has been able to link as many people to
      public sector jobs. This is a noteworthy achievement not just because of
      the numbers involved but also because of the transparency in the process
      and emphasis on merit-based selection. For a state that had been riddled
      with corruption and “sifarish”-based recruitment, this was a paradigm
      shift. The period also saw the largest one-time recruitment of over 18,000
      people to Group D government jobs. In November 2018, more than 17 lakh
      people applied for these jobs and criss-crossed across the state to write
      the recruitment exam. New trains had to be brought into service to
      facilitate this sudden increase in intra-state travel.
