overview:
  - text: "Today, technology has become the backbone for driving large scale systemic governance reforms. Through our deep experience of working closely with the administrative and political leadership in the state we have observed that all governments are anxious to build or use technology applications to streamline governance functions. However, often during implementation of these projects nuanced\_understanding of governance technology life cycle, end user focus,and\_post deployment sustainability of products is not considered adequately. At Samagra, we envisage a future where citizens are active contributors and equal participants in enabling technology enabled governance reforms. To enable this change we at Samagra are following a lego block approach to build scalable and reusable\_opensource\_technology products for\_and collaboratively with the governments."

  - text: "At Samagra, we are building configurable and scalable lego blocks using existing opensource technologies. Powered with these lego blocks we collaborate with governments to identify and abstract product requirements, build and test products, launch and\_finally hand these products\_to government technology teams. Through this governance focussed technology life cycle we enable government stakeholders to reimagine transformative governance use cases that can be collaboratively implemented at scale using opensource\_technologies."

        workflow management for complex screen navigation that enables state
        education department officials in Haryana at different levels to capture
        data from all the different monitoring visits. The key innovation in
        this application is that non-technical government officials can
        seamlessly configure authentication of user, roles of users and data
        input designs. The data is directly linked to a decision support system
        that is further used for driving periodic administrative reviews.
