overview:
  - text: >-
      Today, technology has become the backbone for driving large scale systemic
      governance reforms. Through our deep experience of working closely with
      the administrative and political leadership in the state we have observed
      that all governments are anxious to build or use technology applications
      to streamline their functioning. However, governments lack an
      understanding of the technology life cycle, lack end user focus in their
      technology applications, have a challenge to sustain products after they
      are deployed and often spend high budgets on building simple technology
      applications. At Samagra, we envisage a future where citizens are active
      contributors and equal participants towards good governance. To enable
      this change the technology used by the government is end user centric,
      engineered with high reusability and scalability, and is managed through a
      collaborative partnership of diverse stakeholders within and outside the
      government.

        enables teachers to send SMS based updates to parents to inform them
        about upcoming school holidays, examination announcements or a parent
        teacher meeting. By enabling this use case parents of children studying

        Saksham Samiksha is a mobile solution that is used to drive all
        monitoring visits for the education department in Haryana. Education
        department officials at different levels use this application to capture
        data from their visits. The data is directly linked to a set of
        dashboards that are used for driving different periodic reviews. The key
        innovation in this application is that non-technical government
        officials can seamlessly configure multiple sections of the applications
        such as user management, form creation, form access control thereby
        creating higher buy-in and sustainability of the product once deployed.
        Launched by the Haryana Chief Minister on 26 July 2019.
