overview:
  - text: "Today, technology has become the backbone for driving large scale systemic governance reforms. Through our deep experience of working closely with the administrative and political leadership in the state we have observed that all governments are anxious to build or use technology applications to streamline governance functions. However, often during implementation of these projects nuanced\_understanding of governance technology life cycle, end user focus,and\_post deployment sustainability of products is not considered adequately. At Samagra, we envisage a future where citizens are active contributors and equal participants in enabling technology enabled governance reforms. To enable this change we at Samagra are following a lego block approach to build scalable and reusable\_opensource\_technology products for\_and collaboratively with the governments."
