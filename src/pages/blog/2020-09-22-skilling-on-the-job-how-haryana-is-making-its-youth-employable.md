Industrial Training Institutes in India trace their origins as far back as the 1950s. They were established to provide skilled manpower to industries. However, since the 1950s, when the first steps towards industrial training were taken, the ecosystem has not seen significant innovation. 

**What is Dual System of Training**

In 2005, Germany pioneered the Dual System of Training (DST) model.  A decade later, India boarded the DST bandwagon when the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) formally launched DST to be rolled out in ITIs.

As of 2019, 740 plus units (a unit is equivalent to a classroom, consisting of 25 trainees per unit) in the country have been implementing DST, with the potential to train 14,000 trainees per year on the latest machinery available at partner industries. While trainees undergo theoretical training in the classroom in addition to and basic practical training, DST provides them  an opportunity to learn on the job while working in the industry premises. This is different from the traditional apprenticeship model, as trainees get to work and learn in the industry while studying, and not after. Apart from theoretical and practical knowledge, trainees also learn professional skills in the industry, which are vital in any job.



This blog is a primer on DST and Haryana’s experience implementing it in the 2019-2020academic year.



Haryana’s DST Experience: The Framework

Haryana implemented DST in 72 units in the 2019-20 academic year, which constitutes around 10% of all 740 DST units in the country. Around 40 industries partnered with 27 ITIs across the state to run courses in the DST mode. To ensure effective implementation of DST, the state designed a framework that would answer these critical questions:
